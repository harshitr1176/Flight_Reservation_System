# Flight_Reservation_System

* Flight reservation is one of the most common real-time applications which uses graphs.

* The aim is to create an application which will do easy routing of flights between cities and book tickets for whichever flight route the user decides to take, after viewing all    the available options as well as the filtered options.

* Multiple graph based algorithms to compute the paths are used to make this system as efficient as possible

* Dijkstra to find the cheapest and the quickest flight.

* Depth first search to compute all the paths.

* Linked List for storing the data of the tickets that have been used.
